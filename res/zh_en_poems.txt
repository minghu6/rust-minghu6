无题（一）李商隐（813-858）

相见时难别亦难，东风无力百花残。
春蚕到死丝方尽，蜡炬成灰泪始干。
晓镜但愁云鬓改，夜吟应觉月光寒。
蓬山此去无多路，青鸟殷勤为探看。

锦瑟 李商隐（813-858）

锦瑟无端五十弦，一弦一柱思华年。
庄生晓梦迷蝴蝶，望帝春心托杜鹃。
沧海月明珠有泪，蓝田日暖玉生烟。
此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然。


UNTITLED By Li Shangyin

Hard it was to meet you hard as well to say goodbye.
The east wind’s powerless1, all flowers die.
Only when a spring silk-worm perishes, would its silk be exhausted;
Only when a candle burns to ashes, would its tears dry.
At dawn by the mirror, you’d worry your hair may change;
By night reciting poems, you’d feel the moonlight’s chill above high.
The Penglai Mount3 is not far from here: Green bird4, to look for her please diligently try.


THE ORNATE ZITHER By Li Shangyin

For no reason, the ornate zither has fifty strings;
Each string with its fret evokes recollection of a youthful spring.
Zhuangzi was baffled by his dawn dream of being a butterfly;
The cuckoo was entrusted with the tender soul of a king.
In the green sea under a bright moon, tears would turn into pearls;
In Lantian under a warm sun, rising mists the jade would bring.
Such feeling may be left to memories Only at thetime it was a puzzling thing.
